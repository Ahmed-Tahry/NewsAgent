- Name: Microsoft, Profile: Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology conglomerate headquartered in Redmond, Washington.

It is the largest software maker, one of the most valuable public companies, and one of the most valuable brands globally. Microsoft is considered part of the Big Tech group, alongside Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta.
Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen to market BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. During the 41 years from 1980 to 2021 Microsoft released 9 versions of MS-DOS with a median frequency of 2 years, and 13 versions of Windows with a median frequency of 3 years. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market. Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000. He oversaw the then-largest of Microsoft's corporate acquisitions in Skype Technologies in 2011, an increased focus on hardware that led to its first in-house PC line, the Surface, in 2012, and the formation of Microsoft Mobile through Nokia. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has changed focus towards cloud computing, as well as its acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in 2016. Under Nadella's direction, the company has expanded its video gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the Microsoft Gaming division in 2022 and the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in 2023.
Microsoft has been dominant in the IBM PC–compatible operating system market and the office software suite market since the 1990s. Its best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems and the Microsoft Office and Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, which most notably include the Word word processor, Excel spreadsheet editor, and the PowerPoint presentation program. Its flagship hardware products are the Surface lineup of personal computers and Xbox video game consoles, the latter of which includes the Xbox network; the company also provides a range of consumer Internet services such as Bing web search, the MSN web portal, the Outlook.com (Hotmail) email service and the Microsoft Store. In the enterprise and development fields, Microsoft most notably provides the Azure cloud computing platform, Microsoft SQL Server database software, and Visual Studio.
In April 2019, Microsoft became the third public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion. It has been criticized for its monopolistic practices, and the company's software received criticism for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.

On June 20, 2019, Slack Technologies went public on the New York Stock Exchange via a direct stock listing. On December 1, 2020, Salesforce announced its acquisition of Slack for $27.7 billion. On July 21, 2021, the acquisition was closed.

Article Text: 
SAN FRANCISCO – In a landmark deal poised to reshape the future of work, enterprise software giant Salesforce announced Tuesday its definitive agreement to acquire workplace collaboration platform Slack Technologies for approximately $27.7 billion in cash and stock. The move marks Salesforce's largest-ever acquisition and positions it to compete directly with Microsoft in the booming market for team communication tools.

The acquisition brings together Salesforce's dominant Customer 360 platform with Slack, one of the most beloved communication tools in the tech industry. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff hailed the combination as a 'match made in heaven,' stating that together, 'Salesforce and Slack will shape the future of enterprise software and transform the way everyone works in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere world.'

Under the terms of the deal, Slack shareholders will receive $26.79 in cash and 0.0776 shares of Salesforce common stock for each Slack share. This represents a significant premium on Slack's recent trading price on the New York Stock Exchange. Stewart Butterfield, Slack's CEO and co-founder, is expected to continue leading the Slack unit within Salesforce upon the deal's closure, which is anticipated in the second quarter of Salesforce’s fiscal year 2022.

'This is the most strategic combination in the history of software,' Butterfield said in a statement. 'I can’t wait to get going.'

The deal is a clear challenge to Microsoft, whose Teams product has seen explosive growth, often bundled with its popular Office 365 suite. By integrating Slack's channel-based messaging platform, Salesforce aims to create a comprehensive 'operating system for your workday,' deeply embedding communication within its core sales, service, and marketing products. Analysts believe this integration could create a stickier ecosystem for Salesforce customers, making it harder for competitors to poach clients. The transaction is subject to approval by Slack stockholders and regulatory authorities.
